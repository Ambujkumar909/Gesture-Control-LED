# Gesture-Control-LED



This project demonstrates how to automate LED control using computer vision and gesture recognition. It uses **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to track hand gestures and control LEDs based on predefined gestures.

## Features
- Gesture-based control for LED automation.
- Real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe.
- Easy integration with physical LED setups.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Arduino (or any microcontroller) for hardware integration (optional for simulation).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LED-Automation-CV-Mediapipe.git
   cd LED-Automation-CV-Mediapipe
